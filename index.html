                <h2>Why we recommend adopting</h2>
                <p>There are so many reasons to adopt: meeting a unique pet, spending less, doing a good deed—but let’s talk facts. Millions of pets enter shelters every year. And hundreds of thousands are euthanized each year. We don’t tell you that to guilt you or be a downer, but that’s why adoption really matters to us. So we would love it if you considered adopting. And, since you're here, we’re guessing you are. Seriously, no judgment if you find a pet another way (every pet parent journey is different!). But we’re here to help make adoption easier, however we can.</p>
